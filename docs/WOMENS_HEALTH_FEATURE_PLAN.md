## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Model
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  cycleData: {
    lastPeriodStart: Date,
    averageCycleLength: number (default: 28),
    cycleHistory: [
      { startDate: Date, endDate: Date, flow: string, symptoms: [] }
    ],
    currentDay: number,
    currentPhase: 'menstrual' | 'follicular' | 'ovulation' | 'luteal',
    predictions: {
      nextPeriod: Date,
      nextOvulation: Date
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase Calculation Logic
```javascript
const getPhase = (dayOfCycle) => {
  if (dayOfCycle <= 5) return 'menstrual';
  if (dayOfCycle <= 13) return 'follicular';
  if (dayOfCycle <= 16) return 'ovulation';
  return 'luteal';
};
```
